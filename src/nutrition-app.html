                    This nutrition app enables users to discover personalized
                    recipes based on their dietary needs. Whether following a
                    nutritional program for athletic goals or adhering to
                    specific diets like vegetarian, pescatarian, or paleo, users
                    can easily find tailored meal ideas. It features a
                    responsive and accessible interface and integrates
                    third-party APIs for recipe searches and detailed
                    nutritional breakdowns. I built this project from scratch
                    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I harnessed the power
                    of Firebase for full-stack functionality. This project
                    strengthened my skills in responsive design, modular coding,
                    and API integration.

                    This project was inspired by my own experience of trying to
                    follow specific dietary requirements but struggling to find
                    a variety of appealing meals. There are services available
                    to help in such scenarios, such as professional
                    nutritionists and ready-made meal delivery services, but
                    these are often highly expensive. I realised many people
                    share these frustrations and ultimately fail to reach their
                    goals as a result, so I wanted to create a free tool that
                    would remove these barriers and empower people to easily
                    discover nutritious, satisfying recipes that are tailored to
                    their personal needs.

                    While my goal was to create a polished product that people
                    find useful and valuable, this project, like all my
                    projects, was also a learning exercise. I specifically
                    wanted to deepen my understanding of APIs and how to

                    Responsive design was a top priority for me, ensuring the
                    app delivers a seamless experience across desktops, tablets,
                    and mobile devices. I achieved this by using relative units,
                    fluid design, media queries, and modern CSS layout
                    techniques like Flexbox. This approach guarantees the app
                    looks great and remains fully functional, no matter the
                    screen size.

                    efficient code. I used Webpack to bundle the code, which

                    I built the backend using Firebase, which was an ideal
                    choice due to its scalability and simplified server
                    management. I utilized several Firebase services, including
                    Authentication for secure user sign-in, Firestore to store
                    user accounts and saved recipes, Cloud Functions for
                    serverless API requests, and Hosting for smooth, reliable

                  <h3>CORS</h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the key challenges I encountered during development
                    was dealing with CORS issues when making API requests.
                    Initially, I faced errors when my frontend tried to
                    communicate with the backend, as well as when the backend
                    made requests to third-party APIs. This typically happens
                    when the server doesn’t include the necessary headers,
                    causing the browser to block the request for security
                    reasons. To resolve this, I configured CORS settings on my
                    Firebase Functions, ensuring that the appropriate headers
                    were included in the server’s responses. For third-party
                    APIs, I routed requests through my backend, acting as a
                    proxy to avoid direct cross-origin requests from the client
                    side. These solutions not only resolved the errors but also
                    gave me a much clearer understanding of how CORS policies
                    work and how to navigate them effectively.

                  <h3>Accessible Modals</h3>
                  <p>
                    Accessibility is a key focus in my projects, so it was
                    important to ensure the app’s modals were usable for
                    everyone. Developing accessible modals can be complex, as it
                    requires managing focus, enabling keyboard navigation, and
                    providing clear context for screen readers. To address these
                    challenges, I integrated a modal component from the a11y
                    community, using npm, which follows accessibility best
                    practices. This ensured that focus was properly trapped
                    within the modal, users could navigate it entirely via
                    keyboard, and appropriate ARIA attributes were applied. This
                    approach not only enhanced accessibility but also
                    streamlined development by promoting code reuse.

                  <h3>Firebase</h3>
                  <p>
                    By leveraging Firebase, I avoided the need to build a server
                    from scratch and was able to focus on the frontend, where my
                    strengths lie. While I plan to continue developing my
                    Node.js skills, working with Firebase has given me the
                    confidence to build full-stack applications and bring new
                    project ideas to life more efficiently going forward.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Modular Code</h3>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the project, I gained a deeper understanding of
                    modularity and the importance of well-organized code. I
                    consistently broke down my JavaScript into manageable
                    modules, importing them where needed to keep the codebase
                    clean and maintainable. I also learned how to effectively
                    use Webpack to bundle these modules, optimize performance,
                    and streamline the development process. While my ability to
                    write modular code is an ongoing process, this project gave
                    me a solid foundation to build on as I continue refining my
                    skills.

                  <h3>APIs</h3>
                  <p>
                    This project has a strong focus on APIs, harnessing two
                    third-party services to enhance functionality. It’s been an
                    invaluable learning experience, helping me understand how to
                    seamlessly integrate APIs using the Fetch API. This skill
                    significantly broadens the potential of my future projects,
                    allowing me to expand functionality and create more dynamic,
                    data-driven applications.
